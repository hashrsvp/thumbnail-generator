## Deployment Readiness: **NOT READY** üî¥

### Critical Blockers:
1. **Performance:** 13x slower than production target
2. **Data Quality:** Title and venue extraction failing
3. **Address Integration:** Bay Area database not connected

### Path to Deployment:
**4-5 weeks** with focused optimization on:
1. Performance optimization (Week 1-2)
2. Data quality enhancement (Week 2-3) 
3. Venue-specific patterns (Week 3-4)
4. Production validation (Week 4-5)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Fix performance bottlenecks (Layer timeouts)
2. **Week 2:** Implement parallel processing  
3. **Week 3:** Add venue-specific extraction patterns
4. **Week 4:** Integrate Bay Area venue database
5. **Week 5:** Production validation testing
